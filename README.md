# DATA572_Project
This is the repo for DATA 572

## Description
In this repo, we will be doing the analysis on the milk qualiy data set and use three models to predict the quality of the milk.

## Choice of models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Parts of the project
- Data preprocessing (Use appropriate techniques to preprocess data)
- Model building(Build three proper models with the three supervised machine learning methods chosen)
- Hyperparameter tuning(Tune the respective hyperparameters of the three models to improve their performance)
- Analysis and discussion(Analyze and discuss the performance of the three models and the strategies you used for performance improvement, as well as the difficulties you encountered and how you solved them)
